# Universal Android Security Bypass Suite

A universal, non-customized Frida script for bypassing security mechanisms in Android applications. This script works out-of-the-box across different Android versions and applications without requiring app-specific modifications.

> **Important:** This is a universal bypass script, not a customized solution. It's designed to work across different Android versions and applications without modifications.

> **Note about Stability:** As with any universal bypass solution, crashes may occur:
> - Some applications may crash on first attempt - retry 2-3 times
> - If persistent crashes occur, try:
>   - Restarting the target application
>   - Relaunching Frida
>   - Clearing app data/cache
>   - Running with `-f` flag instead of `-F`
> - Success rate varies by application and protection mechanisms

## Core Features

### Universal Compatibility
- Works across all Android versions (5.0 - 14.0+)
- No app-specific customization needed
- Framework-agnostic implementation
- Automatic detection and bypass of security features

### Key Bypass Mechanisms
1. **Universal Root Detection Bypass**
   - Common root file path checks
   - Package manager detection
   - System property checks
   - Runtime command execution
   - Build property modifications

2. **Universal SSL Pinning Bypass**
   - TrustManager implementation
   - WebView SSL error handling
   - OkHttp certificate pinning
   - Universal SSL context modification

3. **Universal Memory Protection**
   - Generic memory range protection
   - Cross-version memory access handling
   - Basic memory restriction bypasses

## Limitations

### Known Limitations
1. **Root Detection**
   - May not bypass highly customized root detection
   - Some app-specific root checks might still work
   - Custom hardware attestation not bypassed

2. **SSL Pinning**
   - Custom certificate validation may require additional handling
   - Some advanced pinning techniques might not be bypassed
   - Network security configuration overrides may vary

3. **General**
   - No bypass for hardware-backed security features
   - Some app-specific security measures might remain
   - Not designed for highly sophisticated protection mechanisms

### What This Script Won't Do
- Bypass hardware-based security
- Handle app-specific custom implementations
- Bypass sophisticated anti-tampering
- Override hardware attestation
- Bypass custom security frameworks

## Usage

### Basic Setup
```bash
# Load the script
frida -U -l root_bypass.js -f com.target.application
```


## Technical Details

### Universal Design Principles
- Framework-agnostic hooks
- Generic bypass implementations
- No app-specific logic
- Minimal dependencies
- Cross-version compatibility

### Implementation Approach
- Uses common Android APIs
- Implements basic security bypasses
- Focuses on universal detection methods
- Avoids version-specific code
- Maintains simplicity for reliability

## Security Notice

This universal bypass script is intended for:
- Security research
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability assessment

**Important:** 
- This is not a silver bullet
- Some protections may remain active
- Advanced security measures might require custom solutions
- Always test thoroughly in your specific use case

## Advantages of Universal Approach
- Works immediately without customization
- No need for app-specific modifications
- Consistent behavior across apps
- Easy to maintain and update
- Reliable base functionality

## Limitations of Universal Approach
- Cannot handle all edge cases
- May miss app-specific protections
- Limited to common security measures
- Basic protection bypass only
- No advanced feature handling

## Best Practices
1. Use as initial bypass attempt
2. Monitor for unhandled protections
3. Consider supplementing with custom code if needed
4. Test thoroughly on target application
5. Be aware of limitations
6. For crash handling:
   - Always try multiple attempts
   - Monitor logcat for specific errors
   - Consider timing of script injection
   - Use appropriate Frida launch flags
